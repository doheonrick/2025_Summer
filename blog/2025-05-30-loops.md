## 1. for Loop

Print numbers from 1 to 10:

```cpp
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i)
{
    std::cout << i << " ";
}
std::cout << "\n";

## 2. while Loop
int i = 1;
int sum = 0;
while (i <= 10)
{
    sum += i;
    ++i;
}
std::cout << "Sum: " << sum << "\n";

## 3. do while Loop
int num;
do
{
    std::cout << "Enter a number (0 to quit): ";
    std::cin >> num;
    if (num != 0)
        std::cout << "  You typed: " << num << "\n";
} while (num != 0);

## 4. Practice Problem Solved
1 to n sum

Factorial calculation

Even/odd check from 1 to 20

Multiplication table (2 to 9)
